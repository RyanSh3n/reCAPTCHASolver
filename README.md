# reCAPTCHASolver
Here's a link to an article I wrote on this: https://ryansh3n.medium.com/cracking-recaptchas-with-cnns-and-transfer-learning-edc26ab675ec - this contains more high-level knowledge about what CNNs and transfer learning is.

Here's a link to the video I made where I go more in-depth in the code and explain my though process: https://youtu.be/eSK3fKKZroI

In this model, I use transfer learning with the VGG16 model to label reCAPTCHA images. The training dataset is from https://github.com/deathlyface/recaptcha-dataset.

VGG16 is a convolutional neural network model proposed at the University of Oxford in the paper “Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition”. The model achieves 92.7% top-5 test accuracy in ImageNet, which is a dataset of over 14 million images belonging to 1000 classes.

Using the pre-trained network on images not in the training set is called transfer learning. Here, I use transfer learning to train a network to classify reCAPTCHA images with an overall accuracy of 82%.

Note: I edited out some of the data because it had classes that the VGG16 model was not trained to recognize and therefore would be less effective with. Then, I removed a bit more of the data so that there would be a balanced distribution of around 1000 images per class. This was important because some classes had 3000 images while others had 800 making the model rapidly overfit the data.
